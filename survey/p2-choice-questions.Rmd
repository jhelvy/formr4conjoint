# Great work! 

Now that you've shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider a shopping scenario in which you can choose some apples to purchase from a set of apples with different attributes.

Let's learn about these attributes:

## Price

Price refers to the full price you will pay (including taxes) for the apples

## Freshness

The freshness of the apple will be presented as one of three different categories:

- **Excellent**: No bruising or marks. 
- **Average**: One or two light bruises. 
- **Poor**: Multiple bruises and marks.

## Type

We will show five different types of apples:

Fuji | Gala | Honeycrisp | Pink Lady | Red Delicious
-----|------|------------|-----------|--------------

We'll now begin the choice tasks. On the next few pages we will show you three options of apples and we'll ask you to choose the one you most prefer. 

For example, if these were the only apples available, which would you choose?

[mc_button type question with the following three options]

**Option 1**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhelvy/formr4conjoint/master/survey/images/fuji.jpg" width=100>

**Type**: Fuji
**Price**: $ 2 / lb
**Freshness**: Poor

**Option 2**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhelvy/formr4conjoint/master/survey/images/fuji.jpg" width=100>

**Type**: Fuji
**Price**: $ 1 / lb
**Freshness**: Excellent

**Option 3**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhelvy/formr4conjoint/master/survey/images/fuji.jpg" width=100>

**Type**: Fuji
**Price**: $ 3 / lb
**Freshness**: Average

# Great work!

We will now show you 8 sets of choice questions starting on the next page.

[mc_button type question with the following three options]

(1 of 8) If these were your only options, which would you choose?

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
alts <- jsonlite::fromJSON(df_json) %>% 
  filter(qID == 1)
alt1 <- alts %>% filter(altID == 1)
alt2 <- alts %>% filter(altID == 2)
alt3 <- alts %>% filter(altID == 3)
```

**Option 1**

<img src=`r alt1$image` width=100>

**Type**: `r alt1$type`
**Price**: $ `r alt1$price` / lb
**Freshness**: `r alt1$freshness`

**Option 2**

<img src=`r alt2$image` width=100>

**Type**: `r alt2$type`
**Price**: $ `r alt2$price` / lb
**Freshness**: `r alt2$freshness`

**Option 3**

<img src=`r alt3$image` width=100>

**Type**: `r alt3$type`
**Price**: $ `r alt3$price` / lb
**Freshness**: `r alt3$freshness`

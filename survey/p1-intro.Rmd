# Welcome to our survey!

For this survey, we will ask you about your preferences for different types of apples.

---

Do you like fruit?

- Yes!
- Kind of
- No :(

What is your favorite fruit?

(open text response)

---

Before we go on, please select which color you prefer between these two:

- Blue
- Red

(For this example, I'm using the response here to screen out respondents - I'm only interested in people who choose "Red", so if you choose "Blue" you'll be screened out. Usually you would not tell respondents ahead of time how they will be screened - I'm just putting an explanation here since this whole survey is for demonstration purposes)
